BIEN202 Project_Attenuation coefficient simulation in Python

## Background
A basic property of light is that it losses its intensity the further it propagates from its light source. The phenomena of intensity of light decreasing in proportion to the distance from the source is called light attenuation. The power of a light beam traveling through a medium is attenuated along its path due to scattering and absorption. The attenuation depends on the specific optical properties of that tissue or medium. 
Based on the single scattering model, I simulated the attenuation coefficient of each pixel in biological tissue depth profiles with single and multiple layers with Python.

Assumption: The first and key assumption is that all the light from the single-wavelength source is attenuated within the recorded imaging depth range.The second assumption is that the backscattered light is reflected towards the photo detector is a fixed fraction of the attenuated light and a fixed conversion factor that accounts for the digitization of the signal.
